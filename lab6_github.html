<h1 color="red">What is Git </h1>
<p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system 
designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
 speed and efficiency.</p>

<p>Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast 
performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, 
Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, 
convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.</p>

<h1 color="green">What is GitHub</h1>
<p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
 It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.</p>

</p>This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches,
 commits, and Pull Requests. You’ll create your own Hello World 
repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way 
to create and review code.</p>

<h1>What is different between git and Github</h1>
<p>what's the difference? Simply put, Git is a version control system
 that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.
 GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage 
Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, 
then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.
